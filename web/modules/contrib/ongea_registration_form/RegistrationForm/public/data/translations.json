If you really want, you can also create more travels, like: One travel for the train to the airport, a second travel for the flight, and a third one for the bus from the airport to the activity. This is more work, but will give participants using the OnGea app more details (important in cases where participants travel without an experienced group leader).\nAn easy way to use travels would be:\n1. Define a meeting point and time for the group for the arrival date and write that information under “From”.\n2. Describe the last point of the travel for that you can estimate the arrival time well under “To”. This could be the arrival airport; or better, in case you have access to this information: A railway/metro/bus station close to the activity; or best: the actual activity location.\n3. Check the “arrival at activity” checkbox (this means: host organisation will be informed about place and time of this arrival)\n4. Assign this travel to all participants from your group (in case some travel separate, you can edit this under “Mobilities”)\n5. Repeat this steps for the travel back, only that in step 3, you now check the “departure from activity” checkbox","contact_data_green":"NO--TRANSLATION","contact_data_yellow":"(yellow): first name(s),
